# educake hack scripts
A little bit of javascript to make completing science homework on educake a little easier.

## how to use (to do homework)
1) paste script from script.js into console when in a quiz
2) click on the `hint` button to autofill the answer

## how to use (for farming)
1) Click on the `GCSE Science - AQA` button
2) Click `quiz` next to "GCSE Science - AQA"
3) Open console, paste in script.js
4) Open console, paste in farming.js
5) Click on the create quiz button, and paste in `restart()` into console to start the farming

## limitations
- will only work for educake science, since my script relies on an answer database
- might make your teacher slightly mad (don't do questions too fast as your teacher can see the time spent per question)
- answer database might be wrong or might miss certain questions - for educake science there are a few questions which my script doesn't have answers for yet
