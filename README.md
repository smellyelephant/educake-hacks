# educake hack scripts
A little bit of javascript to make completing science homework on educake a little easier.

## how to use
1) paste script from script.js into console when in a quiz
2) click on the `hint` button to autofill the answer

## limitations
- will only work for educake science, since my script relies on an answer database
- might make your teacher slightly mad (don't do questions too fast as your teacher can see the time spent per question)
- answer database might be wrong or might miss certain questions - for educake science there are a few questions which my script doesn't have answers for yet
